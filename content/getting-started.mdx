# Getting Started with Multiverse Docs

This guide will help you get started with Multiverse Docs, a modern documentation website built with Next.js and MDX.

## Installation

To create a new Multiverse Docs site, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-docs --use-npm
cd my-docs
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

## Configuration

First, create a `next.config.mjs` file in the root of your project:

```js
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired
});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

Then, create an `mdx-components.tsx` file in the root of your project:

```tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...components,
  };
}
```

## Creating Content

Create a `content` directory in the root of your project. This is where you'll store your MDX files.

```
my-docs/
├── content/
│   └── docs/
│       ├── index.mdx
│       └── getting-started.mdx
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your documentation site.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic Multiverse Docs site up and running, you can:

- Customize the theme
- Add more content
- Configure the sidebar
- Add search functionality
